- [ ] Create chat interface with animations
- [ ] Build demo conversation scripts
- [ ] Add voice permission handling

## Phase 3: Polish and Demo (Week 3)
- [ ] Refine animations for smooth 60fps performance
- [ ] Implement demo controls and navigation
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Optimize for presentation environments
- [ ] Create demo documentation and guides

## Phase 4: Final Testing (Week 4)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing and compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization and profiling
- [ ] Demo rehearsal and flow refinement
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Deployment and hosting setup

## Critical Path Items
1. Voice permission handling (required for all voice features)
2. Animation framework (affects all UI components)
3. Demo state management (coordinates all flows)
4. Audio visualization (core to voice assistant experience)
5. Error boundaries (essential for demo reliability)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Initialize React Project**
   ```bash
   npm init
   npm install react react-dom typescript vite
   ```

2. **Set up Build Configuration**
   - Create tsconfig.json
   - Configure Vite
   - Set up Tailwind CSS

3. **Create Basic Components**
   - Button, Input, Card components
   - Layout components
   - Animation wrappers

4. **Voice Integration Setup**
   - Web Audio API utilities
   - Speech recognition setup
   - Permission handling
