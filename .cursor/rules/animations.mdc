# Animation Guidelines

## Animation Philosophy
- Prioritize 60fps performance over complex effects
- Use CSS transitions and transforms for simple animations
- Leverage Framer Motion for complex orchestrated animations
- Create animation presets for consistent timing and easing
- Design animations that enhance storytelling during demos

## Performance Requirements
- All animations must maintain 60fps on modern browsers
- Use transform and opacity properties for hardware acceleration
- Implement proper will-change CSS property usage
- Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, margin, padding)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript-driven animations

## Animation Library Stack
- **Framer Motion**: Complex component animations and orchestration
- **CSS Transitions**: Simple hover and focus states
- **Lottie**: Complex illustrations and micro-interactions
- **React Spring**: Physics-based animations when needed

## Animation Patterns
- **Entrance**: Fade in with slight scale (scale: 0.95 → 1)
- **Exit**: Fade out with scale down (scale: 1 → 0.95)
- **Voice Active**: Pulsing glow effect with scale variation
- **Loading**: Smooth skeleton animations with shimmer
- **Transitions**: Page transitions with slide and fade

## Implementation Standards
```typescript
// Animation configuration object
const animationConfig = {
  duration: 0.3,
  ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1], // Material Design easing
  initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }
};

// Custom hook pattern
const useVoiceAnimation = () => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  // Animation logic
  return { isActive, controls, variants };
};
```

## Demo-Specific Requirements
- All animations should complete within 500ms for demo pacing
- Provide animation skip/fast-forward for quick demos
- Implement preview modes for testing animation sequences
- Create animation debug tools for development
- Design animations that work well in screen recordings
