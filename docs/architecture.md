# AI Voice Assistant Prototype - Architecture

## System Overview
This prototype demonstrates an AI voice assistant through an interactive React web application. The architecture prioritizes smooth animations, responsive voice interactions, and compelling demo experiences.

## Core Technologies
- **React 18**: Modern React with concurrent features and Suspense
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking for reliable demo performance
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and gesture handling
- **Web Audio API**: Real-time audio processing and visualization
- **Web Speech API**: Speech recognition and synthesis
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom animation utilities
- **Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds

└── utils/               # Utility functions and demo data
```

## State Management Strategy
- **Local State**: useState for component-specific state
- **Demo State**: Context API for flow coordination
- **Voice State**: Custom hook with reducer for complex voice interactions
- **Animation State**: Framer Motion's built-in animation state

## Performance Considerations
- Code splitting by demo flow
- Lazy loading of heavy animation assets
- Efficient audio processing with Web Workers
- Optimized re-rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- Hardware-accelerated animations using CSS transforms

## Demo Flow Coordination
Each demo flow is self-contained but shares common components and state management patterns. Flows can be combined or run independently based on demo requirements.
